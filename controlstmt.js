//**control statmentsIn JavaScript, control statements are programming constructs that enable you to control the flow of execution within your code. They determine which code blocks are executed based on specified conditions or how many times certain code blocks are repeated. Control statements in JavaScript include conditional statements (like if, else, switch), loops (like for, while, do-while).  **/
